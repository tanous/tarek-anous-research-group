I'm an Egyptian/American theoretical physicist. I spent my childhood in Houston Texas, and my teenage years in Cairo. I was drawn to research in string theory and holography, and after academic stints in Ithaca, Boston, Leuven, Boston (again), Vancouver, and Amsterdam, I've landed at Queen Mary University of London.
