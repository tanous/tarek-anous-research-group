title: Matrix QM for M-theory Revisited

event: Matrix Quantum Mechanics for M-theory Revisited
event_url: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1311127/

location: CERN
address:
  street: 24/3-006 - TH Conference Room Espl. des Particules 1 
  city:  Meyrin
  region: Geneva
  postcode: '1211'
  country: Switzerland

summary: |- 
  The theme of this 1-week workshop is on the BFSS and BMN matrix models, DLCQ in string theory and M-theory, and new approaches to study matrix quantum mechanics, such as the quantum mechanics bootstrap. The goal of the workshop includes but is not limited to:

  1. Revisiting the matrix quantum mechanics for M-theory from modern viewpoints (AdS/CFT and flat-space holography).
  2. Applying and developing new techniques to study matrix quantum mechanics (bootstrap, Monte Carlo etc).
  3. Improving our understanding of these models at finite temperature and identifying promising directions for application to the physics of black holes.
