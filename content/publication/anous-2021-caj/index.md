abstract: 
    We present new asymptotic formulas for the distribution of OPE coefficients in conformal field theories. These formulas involve products of four or more coefficients and include light-light-heavy as well as heavy-heavy-heavy contributions. They are derived from crossing symmetry of the six and higher point functions on the plane and should be interpreted as non-Gaussianities in the statistical distribution of the OPE coefficients. We begin with a formula for arbitrary operator exchanges (not necessarily primary) valid in any dimension. This is the first asymptotic formula constraining heavy-heavy-heavy OPE coefficients in $d>2$. For two-dimensional CFTs, we present refined asymptotic formulas stemming from exchanges of quasi-primaries as well as Virasoro primaries.
