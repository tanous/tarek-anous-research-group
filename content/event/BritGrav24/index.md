summary: |- 
  The aim of this meeting is to bring together early-stage researchers working on all aspects of gravitational physics, including astrophysics, cosmology, general relativity, quantum gravity, gravitational-wave data analysis and instrumentation, to exchange results and ideas. Please note that cosmology talks will all be on the 17th April, to avoid overlap with the Royal Society Discussion Meeting on [Challenging the Standard Cosmological Model](https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2024/04/cosmological-model/).

  Following the BritGrav tradition, the meeting will consist of short talks with priority to be given to PhD students and early-career researchers. 

  At the end of the meeting, we will award The Best Student Talk Prize, sponsored by the [IOP Publishing Group](https://ioppublishing.org/). 

  Note that a follow-on meeting to inaugurate the Queen Mary Gravitational Wave Initiative will be held on Thursday 18th April, which attendees may wish to stay for, but must be registered for separately. More details can be found at [here](https://sites.google.com/gwiinauguralmeeting).
